Low Priority:
Wheel Manager/Dictionary: Loading Multiple Files
LoadWheelsFromFile Make bool

Dictionary and wheels are highly coupled
Micro optimisation: Diction ma [tchbox]
N >> M M >> N
M^(N - 2) 
M capped at 24 
can often bail early i.e. if no XZ bail
N - Microoptimisations take MIN_WORD_SIZE might be valid in practice.

system("Pause")


// Dead ends -> Sorting words, dictionary by key and length
// Error in instructions
// Don't add words to the dictionary which are larger than M

1) What if some quantities are negative? e.g. numLettersPerWord numWheels at least MIN_WORD_SIZE
2) Asserts on loading file not good
3) Error checking for loading files
4) If you AddWheels and then LoadFile will break
5) What happens if don't call initalise wheels
6) change validword form numLetters to numWheels
7) RVO e.g. Build String
8) Utility and Utility String
9) IsFinalConfig into utility
10) Reduce magic numbers in tests
11) Horrible names e.g. WordsInDictionary
12) Consider what happens e.g. UnitTest for GenerateDictionary AN AN appears twice.
13) int -> size_t
14) TODO. Size
15) Can cull dictionary based on index i.e. 5 letters idx is 3 don't add 10 letter word
16) Lowest changed index into class
Checks:
1) All functions have capital letter
